[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.1.17[/B][/COLOR]

[B]IMPORTANT:
I have stumbled onto the fact that Fen is being used in a build with a large number of users. I can confirm that is likely the case with a check of my API key's usage over the last month. There are a few possibilites to deal with this:
1. The build needs to make a fork of Fen and use their own API keys with a different addon name and addon id. Also my name FULLY removed from all code within the forked addon. Despite my anger towards this having happened, I am willing to help fork the addon. I'll even do the whole fork if needed.
2. If 1. is not adhered to, I will stop Fen working on whatever skin the build is based on. Yes, I know which skin that is but I will have no choice.
3. If my API usage still does not come down, I will revoke all my API keys and render Fen useless.
I am serious when I say I DO NOT want Fen used within builds. Whilst I have no real power to stop this happening, I would rather nuke the whole addon than have this continue. I have no problem nuking the addon if that is my only choice. I'm sure it won't come to that.

[COLOR red][B]NOTE: "Enable Content for Extras Lists" setting has been reset this update. You will need to re-set your preferences again. Apologies.[/B][/COLOR]
- New resolving code for Easynews. Give it a decent try to see if things improve. If things get worse, open an issue on my github and I will make a setting to choose between old and new method.
- Made "TRAKT: Trending User Lists", "TRAKT: Popular User Lists" and "TRAKT: Search Lists" available to users who are not logged into trakt through Fen.
- Added "Comments" section to Fen's Extras window. These come from Trakt and are user comments on the Movie/TV Show. Often these also have a rating. As a result of adding this section, you will unfortunately need to re-set your preferences for what appears in the Extras window.
- Extras' window "Trivia" and "Bloopers" is currently broken. They will not appear whether selected or not.
- Limit for Trakt hidden items raised to 1500.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.1.16[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'basic', 'material_design', 'webcolors', 'rainbow' color palettes to the color chooser in Fen. Can be changed using the Choose Palette button.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.1.14/15[/B][/COLOR]
- Quick addition of a direct search path that skins (if supported) can use to access "People" search results in Fen: "plugin://plugin.video.fen/?mode=person_direct.search&amp;query="

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.1.13[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Navigation->Content->"Watched (Still Airing) TV Shows Location" setting. Choose between "Watched", "In Progress" or "Both". Decides where watched tv shows that will have future episodes airing will be placed.
- Changes to resolving code, as well as autoplay next episode and autoscrape next episode code. As a byproduct of the changes, once the window notification appears for either, Fen will mark that episode as fully watched. Independent of the current progress of the episode.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.1.12[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Check Accounts Status on Startup" in Provider Accounts settings tab. Enable this to get a dialog on startup when your premium accounts are close to or have run out of days remaining. Default is OFF.
- Added "Use Chapter Info For Alert When Available" to Settings->Playback->Episodes. Used for Autoplay Next Episode. If a chapter is found for the video file that is >= 90% total play time, then Fen will assume that is the start of credits and move the notification for next episode to that time. Be aware, most episode video files dont have chapter info, but it will work if that info is present.
- Changed some behaviors with In Progress TV Shows and Watched TV Shows. New behavior: For TV Shows where all episodes have been watched, but the TV Show is still airing, that TV Show will now appear in In Progress TV Shows instead of Watched TV Shows. Watched TV Shows will now exclusively be for TV Shows that have all episodes watched and has finished airing (there will be no new episodes in the future).
- Other changes/fixes.

- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.1.09[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Networks" to Movies menu. You will need to navigate into the Movies menu, then context menu: Edit Menu->Check if Movies Menu has new Menu item. Then add "Networks" where you want it in the list. If that fails, select Restore Movies menu to Default.
- Added simple window stack manager for opening subsequent Extras/People custom windows. The previous window will now close and re-open when the new window is closed. Much better for lower specced hardware.
- Added ability to upload OLD Kodi log to Tools.
- Added multiple pages to Trending/Popular Trakt lists. Lists lowered to 50 per page.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.1.01[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Settings->General->General->"Wait for Fen Services to Initiate Before Making Widgets". More for Kodi 20 users, this setting will stop widgets being made until after Fen services has run. It is important for Fen's services to run before widgets are made, as some services check Fen's settings file is created, Fen's databases are made and correct etc. This is OFF by default.
- Added "Playback Options..." to context menu for Movies and Episodes. No need to navigate to "Options..." first anymore.
- Added quite a few "Category" values whilst browsing Fen. This will show as breadcrumbs on supprting skins.
- A fair few under the hood changes and fixes that I lost track of before writing this changelog.
