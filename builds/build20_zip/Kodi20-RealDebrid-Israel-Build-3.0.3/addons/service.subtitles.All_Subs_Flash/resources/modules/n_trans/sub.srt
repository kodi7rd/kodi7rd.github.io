<i>None so far have withstood the onslaught.</i>

<i>But Allied soldiers from across

27

<i>the man who would become Captain America.</i>

28
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:48,113
<i>Although young Rogers was
too frail for combat,</i>

29
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:50,667
<i>his fighting spirit
wouldn't give up.</i>

30
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:54,361
<i>He volunteered for a secret

<i>and, with the help of the country's

<i>super soldier.</i>

34

<i>And now he fights alongside
the Allies</i>

35

<i>as a symbol of freedom and
liberty for all the world.</i>

36
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:12,882

<i>against the dreaded Red Skull</i>

38
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,184
<i>and his Hydra forces.</i>

39
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,675
<i>Good luck, Captain America,</i>

40
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:22,576
<i>wherever you are.</i>

41
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:45,499
We're sitting ducks out here.

42
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,247
Howlett, I need recon!

43
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:48,900
I'm working on it, bub.

44
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:05,045
This is the end of the line, boys.

45
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:07,937
Our job is to take down
Hydra's science base,

46
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:11,136
and we've already got a man
on the inside to get us in.

47
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:15,848
Now let's go show the Red
Skull that his day is over!

48
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:26,370
Lieutenant Strucker.

49
00:04:27,553 --> 00:04:28,845
Report.

50
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,700
Herr Skull, the Allies
have found the fortress.

51
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,663
Captain America is with them.

52
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:36,769
Send your best regiment out to confront him.

53
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:39,888
He will defeat them, of course,

54
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:43,712
but it will give us time
to prepare the specimens.

55
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:47,177
This will be the perfect test.

56
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:49,668
Sorry, Sarge. It's one of a kind.

57
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,725
Jack.

58
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:02,574
Jack!

59
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:17,955
Uh-- You're late.

60
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:25,335
Any trouble inside, Bucky?

61
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:27,908
There are Hydra
soldiers everywhere.

62
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:29,795
I couldn't get into the
lower levels on my own

63
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:32,323
without raising the alarm,
but I know the way.

64
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:33,858
Not a problem.

65
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:36,902
The stealth portion of this
mission is officially over.

66
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:45,814
I'll knock.

67
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,703
Must be the welcoming committee.

68
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:02,923
I've got this covered.

69
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,094
You know what, Cap?

70
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:11,200
I change my mind. You get this one.

71
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:20,826
Okay, we've seen some
weird stuff in this war,

72
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:23,315
but what is that? I don't know.

73
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,217
One of Zola's experiments, maybe.

74
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:28,033
Whatever it is, it's angry.

75
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,014
Back off, ugly!

76
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:37,029
Cap!

77
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:48,474
You want me, monster?

78
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:50,021
Here I am.

79
00:08:02,654 --> 00:08:03,805
Let's keep moving.

80
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:05,139
Yeah. Sure.

81
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,705
No use dwelling on the big
monster that almost ate us.

82
00:08:15,832 --> 00:08:17,291
Smart bombs.

83
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,316
Nerve gas.

84
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,027
Germ warfare.

85
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:23,908
Okay, this is creeping me out.

86
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:26,304
Hydra's been working on
this stuff for years.

87
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:29,273
Any one of these things could
mean big trouble for the Allies.

88
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,209
That's why we're here, Bucky.

89
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:35,503
No matter what, we're taking
down the Skull once and for all.

90
00:08:48,685 --> 00:08:50,831
What in the world is this, Cap?

91
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:53,108
I'm not so sure this
is from our world.

92
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:57,250
You may come out now, Captain.

93
00:08:57,665 --> 00:08:59,423
I know you are here.

94
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:05,033
You have arrived just in
time to witness history.

95
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:12,087
Ah, you always get me caught.

96
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:14,934
Oh, please, Captain.

97
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:17,422
Even if you were to survive,
your partner would not.

98
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,155
Still doing Zemo's
dirty work, Skull?

99
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:38,710
No. No.

100
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,497
I have stopped looking for
the relics of this world.

101
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,602
Today, I take the
power of another one.

102
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:49,495
Ancient Norse mythology
told of a realm

103
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:52,090
of supernaturally powerful beings.

104
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:56,209
And all myths have
some basis in truth.

105
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:59,161
This cave was the location

106
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,328
of one gateway to that realm.

107
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:06,883
<i>The Norse called it Bifrost--
the Rainbow Bridge.</i>

108
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:10,166
Picture an army of
mythological beasts

109
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:12,648
unleashed upon the battlefield.

110
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,677
The Allies won't even comprehend

111
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:18,186
the forces that are
destroying them.

112
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,649
Looks like your doggy there

113
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,156
would rather gnaw on
you than us, Skull.

114
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:25,493
We have ways of
guiding their choices.

115
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:30,935
What have you done?

116
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,934
What have I done?

117
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:35,269
I have won this war, Captain.

118
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:37,923
Open the portal!

119
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,293

Sir, we've locked on to a specimen.

123
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:14,287
Increase power. Bring it through!

124
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:30,512
Cap? I see it.

125
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:39,730
Now!

126
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:53,112
No! Nooo!

127
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,415
Skull!

128
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:18,264
Get to the portal.

129
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:20,767
Do whatever it takes.
Just close it!

130
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:26,049
Yah!

131
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:35,590
I had hoped to test this blade
on the great Captain America.

132
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,393
You are not worthy to face me.

133
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,803
Is it because I have
more hair than you?

134
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,432
Don't feel bad, Strucker.

135
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:45,028
Maybe when you get older,
it'll grow in.

136
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:54,552
Sloppy technique.

137
00:13:54,582 --> 00:13:56,930
You shave your head with that thing, too?

138
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,356
That would explain a lot.

139
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:15,038
Come on, soldier. Think.

140
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:27,021
Time to go home.

141
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:41,560
Bucky, now!

142
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:02,738
No. No! You have
destroyed everything!

143
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:06,786
I will have my revenge

144
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:09,571
on you and the world!

145
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,765
We have to get out of here!

146
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:13,601
Not this time, partner.

147
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:15,289
We're not letting
him get away again.

148
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,345
There he is. Bucky, stay here.

149
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,123
Secure the fortress.

150
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:59,186
I got your back, Cap!

151
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:02,092
Bucky, I told you to st-- Yeah, I know.

152
00:16:02,122 --> 00:16:03,883
But we're partners, right?

153
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:06,439
Let's finish this.

154
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:15,513
It's over, Skull.

155
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,067
Finally, we agree.

156
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:25,279
Goodbye, Captain America!

157
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,136
No!

158
00:16:32,906 --> 00:16:34,134
There's not enough time!

159
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:36,247
Bucky, jump for it!

160
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:39,188
I can't!

161
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:40,514
Cap!

162
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:42,215
Hang on, Bucky!

163
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:44,348
Sorry, Cap.

164
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,688
Stow that talk. We'll make it.

165
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:48,747
No, I mean, sorry,

166
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:51,959
but the world needs Captain
America more than Bucky.

167
00:16:53,284 --> 00:16:54,135
No!

168
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:57,033
No! Bucky!

169
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:21,456
<i>Today, Earth's mightiest hero</i>

170
00:17:21,486 --> 00:17:23,129
<i>fell in the line of duty.</i>

171
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,263
<i>Farewell, Captain America,</i>

172
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:26,819
<i>wherever you are.</i>

173
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:28,722
No.

174
00:17:28,752 --> 00:17:31,280
Not where. When.

175
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,878
Let's keep moving.

176
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:42,186
Yeah. Sure.

177
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:45,021
No use dwelling on the big
monster that almost ate us.

178
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:50,532
Forward to time index 3.2.

179
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:09,442
I will have my revenge

180
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:11,852
on you and the world!

181
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,118
We have to get out of here!

182
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:16,958
Not this time, partner.

183
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:19,537
We're not letting
him get away again.

184
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:23,832
Ahead 7.25.

185
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,068
I've got your back, Cap!

186
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,194
Ahead .39.

187
00:18:55,228 --> 00:18:59,098
No! No! Bucky!

188
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,755
Mmm. Manual control.

189
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:31,903
<i>Time disturbance in progress.</i>

190
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:36,242
Initiate chronal jump
to Damocles base.

191
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:51,302
<i>Report. Temporal disturbances
reaching critical levels.</i>

192
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:54,696
<i>The fabric of time-space is in
the process of rupturing.</i>

193
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,147
Show me.

194
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:19,143
My entire time line--

195
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:22,813
all of reality is being wiped out,

196
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:25,782
and it's all because of you.

197
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:27,983
My travels into the past

198
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:30,087
suggest that you are the link,

199
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:31,626
Captain America.

200
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:34,169
Some moment in your past

201
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,647
heralds the end of the future.

202
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:39,430
Something to do with you.

203
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:41,533
But I saw you

204
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:44,532
meet your end in the 20th century.

205
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,504
How can you be responsible?
Unless...

206
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:52,976
Damocles, scan all surviving
records from the 21st century.

207
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:54,327
<i>Executing.</i>

208
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:57,972
Freeze image.

209
00:20:58,002 --> 00:20:59,922
Of course.

210
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:01,817
I did not conquer the Earth

211
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:04,288
just to see it wiped
from existence.

212
00:21:04,715 --> 00:21:07,810
Damocles, prepare the fleet for time jump.

213
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:17,841
All ships begin
trans-temporal jump.

214
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:20,113
Sir, we don't have the coordinates.

215
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:21,497
There's not enough time to--

216
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:24,407
Never tell me there's
not enough time.

217
00:21:27,446 --> 00:21:28,968
<i>Time coordinates accepted.</i>

218
00:21:28,998 --> 00:21:31,270
<i>Jump in progress.</i>

219
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:33,049
Where is Princess Ravonna?

220
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,618
She's boarding now, my Lord.

221
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,923
My love, what is happening?

222
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:41,824
Why are we leaving?

223
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:50,366
Ravonna, no!

224
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:58,408
Damocles, now!

225
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:18,114
<i>Update. The time dissolution
has slowed</i>

226
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:19,741
<i>but is still in effect.</i>

227
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:22,619
I'll save you, my love.

228
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:26,317
I'll save our entire time line,

229
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:31,287
even if I have to conquer
this time to do it.

230
00:22:32,305 --> 00:23:32,866
