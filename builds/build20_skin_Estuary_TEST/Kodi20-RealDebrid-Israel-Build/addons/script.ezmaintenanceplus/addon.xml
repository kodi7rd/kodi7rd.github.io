 - Added AutoClean Cache functionality every x days at a given hour.

   Not all addons can handle this replace so it is now possible via a setting to disable this.
 - Backup Cancel didn't work. This is now fixed.

- The plugin was also installed under Video add-ons. Now it only is in Program add-ons where it belongs
