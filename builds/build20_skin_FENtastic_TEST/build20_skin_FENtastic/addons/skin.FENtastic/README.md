# Guidelines for Reporting Issues

- Read the **CHANGELOG**. As new updates get released features are added, changed, modified or removed. *Before opening an Issue* related to this make sure you read the changelog (located at the bottom of Skin settings in Extra info) as it will contain information for all the changes made to each update. It is also a good way to stay current with what is new with the skin.
- **Pre-made builds** of any kind are *not supported*. If you installed someone else's build, you need to go to them to troubleshoot issues. These builds often contain a plethora of addons so any number of things could go wrong. Keep in mind this skin was designed exclusively for use with **FEN**.
- Trakt related Issues are *not supported*. These are not skin related. You'll need to contact the developer of the addon that you are experiencing these types of problems/errors with.
- Error related Issues **MUST** include a log file. Your Issue will be closed immediately if you fail to include a log file.
- Make sure to check all open Issues to see if your problem is being addressed already.
- **DO NOT** hijack an open Issue with unrelated problems. Open a new Issue.
- Do your best to **monitor** the Issue you have opened. If I need additional information and it is not supplied within 7 days, I will close the Issue.
